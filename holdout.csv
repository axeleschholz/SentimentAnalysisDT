-1,Not good enough,"Unfortunately, customer service is not polite at all... Solutions are slow to be found or never found. I am honestly disappointed. Customer service is the reason I will stop using Asos even though they have a great stock. Anyway... I hope it improves. Most of the competitive websites are miles better.",02-Dec-19

1,Issue resolved quickly,"This is the second time I have had to deal with ASOS for a problem with their couriers. ASOS have been great in dealing with my problem. Quick and efficient in dealing with my request. I had to wait for 30 minutes to speak to someone using thier online chat service but this may be because it was Black Friday weekend. Despite this issue, I will use them again.",02-Dec-19
-1,Disappointed with material quality!,I bought what I thought an amazing jumpsuit to celebrate mine and my boyfriends birthday.I paid £40 and the material used was not what I was excepted at all... my jumpsuit completely ripped on the bus! This was extremely humiliating and ruined my mood.The quality of the product was extremely poor. I'm very upset has I waited a month to used this product on this special occasion.Patricia Horta,02-Dec-19
-1,Ordered something black Friday as a…,"Ordered something black Friday as a replacement since the original order I made the day before was a shambles! I received an item that didn't even have tags and seemed worn, but the worst of it I received a NON-ASOS item which was a ragged dirty stained stinking Ralph Lauren polo which someone has obviously sent out instead of what I ordered. I contacted ASOS who didn't have a care in the world about how they had sent me someone's dirty top and didn't offer to help fix the situation considering the top I actually ordered was now out of stock and it would be unlikely that I could buy it again at the Black Friday price. Good luck to you if you ever have an issue as you will receive automated generic responses from people who aren't interested at all. The shock of receiving someone's perfectly folded tissue wrapped old manky t-shirt shows it must have been someone who works there! Either that or they just send orders out in the dark!!!",02-Dec-19
1,Helpful,Very helpful and dealt with my query quickly.,02-Dec-19
-1,£10 per year for a fortnights wait,"Usually great service but placed an order on Black Friday and the delivery date is 11th December, despite paying £10 a year for premium delivery (why bother!). In the T&C’s they’ve covered themselves in case of this so I have no comeback, but yesterday the premium delivery was back up and running- which means that an order placed yesterday/today will be prioritised delivery wise over mine, which is so irritating!",02-Dec-19
-1,Premier Customer... Premier Badly Handled!,"I ordered two parcels a week and a bit ago with my premier delivery as I always do - usually little to no problems - this time, didn’t turn up. Was obviously not impatient enough to deal with it immediately, but a few days in and still no parcels I was irked. Was told when I contacted ASOS that this couldn’t be dealt with until a week later - why? No explanation given. As a premier customer, I was just told that this happens and that it’s in the terms - so basically, pay your subscription and accept if it goes wrong, as a company, they’ll do little to help.  Once that week was up, I was simply told that they didn’t know where they’d gone and would try and get replacements. Bare in mind, both products are currently on the site as out of stock - something that they weren’t a few days ago which if ASOS had dealt with already, would of been with me. Didn’t even have the audacity to suggest pushing the orders quickly, but rather usual standard delivery if everything goes smoothly. It will not!",02-Dec-19

Yet Asos has stated multiple times it’s left the warehouse and with the delivery company? Was then sent an email saying my delivery is delayed until the next working day....15 minutes later I received another email stating I would be receiving my parcel today?....4 hours later once again and I’m still waiting for it?

-1,Still yet to receive my gift card and unclear returns policy,Instead of receiving a refund I got a gift card instead. It was not made clear at all on the returns slip and given that it was a new change in Asos' policy I feel it should have been clearly stated on the slip that a refund would not be generated after 28 days to avoid customer confusion. I assumed 45 days would still follow the exact same returns policy procedure. If I had known I would have made sure to send the items back within 28 days.,01-Dec-19

1,Amazing repair offer and customer service,"I bought a lovely coat from Asos but unfortunately some of the stitching came undone in the armpit. I didn't want to return it for a brand new one as wasn't sure if my size was still in stock but Asos offered to refund the cost of repair and now my coat is good as new. This is a really excellent policy for the environment, our wardrobes and our tailoring industries. Good on you asos! And great customer service.",01-Dec-19
1,Speedy service when I got through!,"Took a while to get through since it's Black Friday/week and the site/chat staff are probably inundated with orders and customers, but when I did, Vicky was so, so helpful esp since i have anxiety and can get really, REALLY stressed over potential delays, unresolved issues etc. They were understanding and sorted out my issues (blocked account and my worries that i wouldn't get a refund for a returned order made on the blocked account) so fast!!",01-Dec-19
1,5 star company,"I have shopped with ASOS for several years now and I have never had any trouble with any deliveries, items have always arrived on time and as shown on website. Any problems have been resolved within a quick time. Customer service is excellent. ASOS have a wide range of products available from their own brand as well as other well-known brands. A great place to shop! Only downside - YOU NEED A STORE :D I love ASOS. Thank you for your great products and customer service.",01-Dec-19
1,Thanks Stuart,"Well I mean, ASOS itself is obviously great, massive selection yada yada yada, but this review is mainly for the customer service I just received. Although I was on hold on live chat for about 40 minutes before getting through to Stuart, it was black Friday weekend, and ASOS had reduced literally everything on their website, so I wasn't surprised. I thought multiple days worth of my orders had been cancelled as I'd had ominous emails sent my way, but Stuart reassured me that thankfully my ridiculous spending spree was still going to eat away at my credit card allowance. Thanks Stuart! Now, back to ASOS....",01-Dec-19

-1,Dissappointed in Asos Delivery (next day - NOT),"I usually love ASOS live chat - usually very helpful HOWEVER i ordered on thursday, expecting delivery saturday because i could have missed the cut off. decided to chat with them which it took a good HOUR to even connect for the lady to tell me my parcel hasnt even left the warehouse!? The lady was obviously apologetic and i stressed i was not angry with her but the fact that i pay for next day delivery for a year and its not even bloody worth it when its likely going to come 5 days after delivering!!! understand its a busy time of year but 1 hour to get onto live chat is a joke and to find out my parcel hasnt even left the warehouse is an even bigger joke!!!",01-Dec-19

-1,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware, customer service is terrible if you have an issue with your order. Check, check and triple check your order. 3 extra units got added to my order for reasons I cannot explain. I tried to cancel within seconds of receiving the confirmation email but the system did not allow for cancellation. Then when I tried to get online help for someone to remove the extra items and at least issue me a credit so I could purchase something else (they claimed cancellation was impossible) they refused. Seems I will have to endure paying for duplicate items that I never intended to order. They know most won't bother sending them back as the international shipping cost at your own expense just adds to your losses. I wonder how many others were caught out with this same unscrupulous practice. Check the reviews and go with a more reputable company that is willing to correct errors with online ordering systems within minutes of placing the order. Will never use this company again.",01-Dec-19

All email folders checked and account didn’t register a return. Online for three days trying to return an item only to be thrown back to my order page. So unable to return item. Extremely frustrating...  Only form of contact is texting. No one to speak to and they’re unable to access accounts. The service is all about the company And money and NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER.","Updated Dec 1, 2019"

The customer service is appalling, they send incorrect items, don't send items and don't refund. In total i'm sure i have wasted on average 20 hrs dealing with ASOS trying to get things rectified - ASOS' issues I might add. DO NOT USE ASOS.",01-Dec-19
