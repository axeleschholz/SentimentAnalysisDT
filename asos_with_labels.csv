After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats. ASOS so far, so good!",14-Dec-19

Contact ASOS who won’t do anything until they speak with currier. Speak to Currier directly says parcel returned due to damage. ASOS won’t accept this for 48hours and now say I have to wait a further 7 days to see if they receive my parcel back and then maybe issue a refund which will take another 7-10 days DO NOT BUT FROM THESE IF YOU’D LIKE TO ACTUALLY GET THE GOODS YOU PAID FOR,14-Dec-19
-1,Terrible experience,Terrible experience. Courier left my parcel in a gas metre and my parcel was unsealed. One whole outfit from my order was missing and no order info or returns label inside. I complain on FB so ASOS send out a replacement parcel... to an old address I don’t live at anymore! Why on earth would you do that?

One of my orders was cancelled and just never arrived so I chased up Asos and finally a replacement order was sent as there was some issue with it apparently. Then when I returned some of the items in my order I did not receive any refund information. I have spent couple of weeks waiting and then sending multiple emails to Asos customer care with no reply. I understand that this is a busy time but I have basically been ignored. I had wanted to do my shopping online to save time and make it easier but it has just been a negative and stressful experience. If I had not kept trying to sort the refund I don't think I would have ever recieved one. I have shopped online many times at Asos but am very upset and disappointed with the service now.,14-Dec-19

-1,Misleading exchange,"I ordered a variety of items from asos on 29/11/19 and recieved my delivery on 09/12/19. I kept the items that were suitable. 4 items were sent back on 10/12/19 at 13:47. 3 items had been selected for a refund and 1 was requested for an exchange. I recieved an email today at 16:57 stating all of the items had been refunded, which I did not want. I first attempted contact around 7pm but had no luck. I recontacted Asos at 23:08 explaining the occurrence to the unhelpful Marta. I was given this - 'I’ve had a look and can see that we still have the jacket in stock – I’m sorry we weren’t able to replace this for you. It could be that none were available when we went to replace your order, which is why we weren’t able to replace it for you' then this 'as the refund has already been accepted by your bank, we're unable to send a replacement.The refund was processed on 13th December. Please allow up to 10 working days for the money to appear in your account. If you'd like, you could place a new order for the jacket and I'll refund your delivery charge. After you've received your shipping confirmation email, just reply to this email with your new order number - and we'll arrange your refund.' I think offering me free delivery was a terrible option, considering it is a mistake on their part. I mentioned I didn't see why I should be paying the now full price for an item where I had asked for it to be exchanged when it was a mistake on their part. Along with wondering if they had my form to view this error on their end. I got offered a 20% voucher, still not good enough when the item was 30% less and I didn't make an error they did. I opted for their exchange service which they have not honoured. I was then given another sad response 'We would only be able to offer a 20% code. The jacket could have been out of stock at the time, in which scenario we would refund you, but may have come back into stock.I'm not able to get your form, this would be at our warehouse.' The availability of this item in the size I have wanted has consistently been available every day since I sent the item back as that is what the website is still currently showing. I asked for this to be escalated as the outcome was not satisfying as I reiterate they have made the error. I was told it would not be escalated as the sales have ended. What does that matter? An escalation was my request. What I was finally left with... 'I completely understand, however the refund has been accepted by your bank and the price has changed so all I could offer is a 20% goodwill gesture.*my response*[23:25:49] What u are offering isn't enough[23:25:57] I didnt ask for a refundASOS[23:26:10] As I'm not able to help further and I've already given you a 20% promo code, I'll close the chat.[23:26:11] ASOS have ended the chatI think this is a real sign of a company trying to manipulate you to spend more on an item they offer exchanges regardless of being bought in the sale. The mistake is from their end and I am clearly being fobbed off with a good will gesture than a solution. Avoiding this being escalated is truly unprofessional.",14-Dec-19

Honestly, I contacted them on every platform and their response rates were awful, and they were rude as well. I have never been treated so poorly by a company.

Any item I've ordered is always either poor quality or defective. Thin material, sizing has always been off, and colors often are different from what is pictured. Going through customer care is the real nightmare though. It takes weeks to get a refund back. They have a policy that says once they receive it at the warehouse, the customer has to wait 10 ADDITIONAL days for them to ""process it at the warehouse"". Still, after the 10 days I've had to contact them to initiate the refund. They rarely get back via email so it's better to use the live chat feature on the website.

0,I'm normally so happy with Asos,I'm normally so happy with Asos. I recieve orders quickly and it all goes to plan. But they obviously can't handle the demands of black Friday as everything I ordered then still hasn't been delivered. I've emailed and messaged and hardly had a response (I got one email back telling me to wait longer). Then finally got onto chatting about my order with someone only to be told all they could do is refund me or try and re-create the order - but only if the stuff was still in stock. Really disappointed with how much they failed over the black friday period.,13-Dec-19

-1,Asos was just Useless,"The customer service was unable to give a credible reason to why my account was blocked and also was unable to get me to the right team needed in order to get my concerns resolved, and finally they were unable to provide a telephone number to speak to a manager or supervisor.

-1,Worst worst worst customer service I…,"Worst worst worst customer service I had yesterday!! I ordered from ASOS on the 3rd of December and chose the next day delivery option. Haven't got any update since from them and have been contacting customer service daily using chat online. Their service was so rude, advicing me to wait until end of each day and if there isn't any progress to contact back in the next day!! I have to apparently wait until the end of 4th working day AFTER MIDNIGHT to contact for a possible refund. But I chose the NEXT DAY DELIVERY OPTION!! The worst bit of the whole experience is I was told off that there is nothing they could do to advice as it was MY FAULT THAT THE LATE DELIVERY BANNER WAS POSTED ON ASOS ON 28 NOVEMBER 2019. I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD READ BEFORE I ORDER IN THE FUTURE. The customer service analyst was also very eager to close the chat and was very sarcastic throughout the conversation. Poor poor service!!",13-Dec-19

-1,Will NEVER order again,"Ordered over 2 weeks before we needed the dress delivered. It was supposed to be to us by Dec 4th. We needed it by Dec 14. When it didn’t come on the 4th we messaged to find out what they could do and they told us we had to wait until after 10 pm on the 10th. There hadn’t been updated shipping info since November 30. It was clear the package was missing but they didn’t seem to care. Instead they just said sorry we don’t actually care that you didn’t get it and we can’t get it to you by the 14th. If they had done something about it the first time we messaged them, they could have fixed the problem but it seems that ASOS doesn’t care about customers. After all that I’ve had to email and message 4 times to get them to process a refund.",13-Dec-19

-1,Wish I could leave 0 stars,Wish I could leave 0 stars. Awful service. Placed an order and had an email to confirm they were very busy but to be assured my order was being dealt with. Never received order confirmation and after a few days I checked on my account and it had an estimated delivery date. After a couple of weeks I had a despatch email but never received the item. A few days later I had an email confirming I had returned the items. I was charged and Asos had my money the entire time with no intention to deliver the items. The items have gone back up in price since. I will not shop there again and would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not reply to you. They just dont care. Avoid at all costs,13-Dec-19
